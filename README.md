## Overview

A *transparent wrapper* that adds **regex**, **aliases**, **gateways**, **includes**, **dynamic hostnames** to **SSH**.

**Advanced SSH config** is wrapped in [lib-ssh](https://www.libssh.org) as a [ProxyCommand](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Proxies_and_Jump_Hosts#ProxyCommand_with_Netcat), it means that it works seamlessly with:

* [ssh](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&sektion=1)
* [scp](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp&sektion=1)
* [rsync](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rsync1.html)
* [git](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/)
* Desktop applications depending on `lib-ssh` or `ssh` (i.e: [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com), [Atom.io](https://atom.io), [SSH Tunnel Manager](http://projects.tynsoe.org/fr/stm/))

## Features

### Configuration features

* **regex** support
* **aliases** `gate` -> `gate.domain.tld`
* **gateways** -> transparent ssh connection chaining
* **includes**: split configuration in multiple files
* **local command execution**: finally the reverse of **RemoteCommand**
* **inheritance**: make hosts inherits from host templates
* **variable expansion**: resolve variables from environment
* **smart proxycommand**: RAW tcp connection when possible with `netcat` and `socat` as default fallbacks

### Using Gateway from command line

Connect to `hosta` using `hostb` as gateway.

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

---

Connect to `host` using `hostb` as a gateway using `hostc` as a gateway.

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb/hostc
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh hostc nc %h %p' hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

### Under the hood features

* Automatically regenerates `~/.ssh/config` file when needed
* Inspect parent process to determine log level (if you use `ssh -vv`, **assh** will automatically be ran in debug mode)
* Automatically creates `ControlPath` directories so you can use *slashes* in your `ControlPath` option

## Configuration

The `~/.ssh/config` file is now managed by `assh`, take care to keep a backup your `~/.ssh/config` file.

`~/.ssh/assh.yml` is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) file containing:

* an `hosts` dictionary containing multiple *HOST* definitions
* a `defaults` section containing global flags
* and an `includes` section containing path to other configuration files

```toml
Includes = [
  "~/.ssh/assh.d/*.yml",
  "/etc/assh.yml"
]

[Hosts]

  [Hosts.homer]
    # ssh homer ->  ssh 1.2.3.4 -p 2222 -u robert
    HostName = "1.2.3.4"
    User = "robert"
    Port = 2222

  [Hosts.bart]
    # ssh bart ->   ssh 5.6.7.8 -u bart           <- direct access
    #            or ssh 5.6.7.8/homer -u bart     <- using homer as a gateway
    HostName = "5.6.7.8"
    User = "bart"
    Gateways = [ "direct", "homer" ]
    # tries a direct access first
    # fallback on homer gateway

  [Hosts.maggie]
    # ssh maggie ->   ssh 5.6.7.8 -u maggie       <- direct access
    #              or ssh 5.6.7.8/homer -u maggie   <- using homer as a gateway
    User = "maggie"
    Inherits = [ "bart" ]   # inherits rules from "bart"

  [Hosts.schooltemplate]
    User = "student"
    IdentityFile = "~/.ssh/school-rsa"
    ForwardX11 = "yes"

  [Hosts.schoolgw]
    # ssh school ->   ssh gw.school.com -l student -o ForwardX11=no -i ~/.ssh/school-rsa
    Hostname = "gw.school.com"
    ForwardX11 = "no"
    Inherits = [ "schooltemplate" ]


  [Hosts."vm-*.school.com"]
    # ssh vm-42.school.com ->   ssh vm-42.school.com/gw.school.com -l student -o ForwardX11=yes -i ~/.ssh/school-rsa
    Gateways = [ "schoolgw" ]
    Inherits = [ "schooltemplate" ]

  [Hosts."*.scw"]
    # ssh toto.scw -> 1. dynamically resolves the IP address
    #                 2. ssh {resolved ip address} -u root -p 22 -o UserKnownHostsFile=null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no
    # requires github.com/scaleway/scaleway-cli
    ResolveCommand = "/bin/sh -c \"scw inspect -f {{.PublicAddress.IP}} server:$(echo %h | sed s/.scw//)\""
    User = "root"
    Port = 22
    UserKnownHostsFile = "/dev/null"
    StrictHostKeyChecking = "no"

[Defaults]
  # Defaults are applied to each hosts
  ControlMaster = "auto"
  ControlPath = "~/tmp/.ssh/cm/%h-%p-%r.sock"
  ControlPersist = "yes"
  Port = 22
  User = "bob"

```

Get a released version on: https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/releases

## Getting started

1. Backup your old `~/.ssh/config`: `cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.backup`
2. Create a new `~/.ssh/assh.yml` file
3. Run `assh proxy localhost` to validates the syntax of your `~/.ssh/assh.yml` file and automatically build your `~/.ssh/config` file
4. You are ready!
