## Overview

A *transparent wrapper* that adds **regex**, **aliases**, **gateways**, **includes**, **dynamic hostnames** to **SSH**.

**Advanced SSH config** is wrapped in [lib-ssh](https://www.libssh.org) as a [ProxyCommand](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Proxies_and_Jump_Hosts#ProxyCommand_with_Netcat), it means that it works seamlessly with:

* [ssh](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ssh&sektion=1)
* [scp](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=scp&sektion=1)
* [rsync](http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/rsync1.html)
* [git](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/)
* Desktop applications depending on `lib-ssh` or `ssh` (i.e: [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com), [Atom.io](https://atom.io), [SSH Tunnel Manager](http://projects.tynsoe.org/fr/stm/))

## Features

### Configuration features

* **regex** support
* **aliases** `gate` -> `gate.domain.tld`
* **gateways** -> transparent ssh connection chaining
* **includes**: split configuration in multiple files
* **local command execution**: finally the reverse of **RemoteCommand**
* **templates**: equivalent to host but you can't connect directly to a template, perfect for inheritance
* **inheritance**: make hosts inherits from host hosts or templates
* **variable expansion**: resolve variables from environment
* **smart proxycommand**: RAW tcp connection when possible with `netcat` and `socat` as default fallbacks

### Using Gateway from command line

Connect to `hosta` using `hostb` as gateway.

```

  │ YOU │─ ─ ─ ─ ─
  └─────┘         │
     ┃            ▽

```

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

---

Connect to `hosta` using `hostb` as a gateway using `hostc` as a gateway.

```

  └─────┘              └─────┘
```

```console
$ ssh hosta/hostb/hostc
user@hosta $
```

Equivalent to `ssh -o ProxyCommand="ssh -o ProxyCommand='ssh hostc nc %h %p' hostb nc %h %p" hosta`

### Under the hood features

* Automatically regenerates `~/.ssh/config` file when needed
* Inspect parent process to determine log level (if you use `ssh -vv`, **assh** will automatically be ran in debug mode)
* Automatically creates `ControlPath` directories so you can use *slashes* in your `ControlPath` option, can be disabled with the `NoControlMasterMkdir: true` configuration in host or globally.

## Configuration

The `~/.ssh/config` file is now managed by `assh`, take care to keep a backup your `~/.ssh/config` file.

`~/.ssh/assh.yml` is a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) file containing:

* an `hosts` dictionary containing multiple *HOST* definitions
* a `defaults` section containing global flags
* and an `includes` section containing path to other configuration files

```yaml
hosts:

  homer:
    # ssh homer ->  ssh 1.2.3.4 -p 2222 -u robert

    - direct                   # tries a direct access first

#### Register the wrapper (optional)

To improve experience when using advanced pattern matching, add the following at the end of your .bashrc or .zshrc:

```bash
alias ssh="assh wrapper"
```

This step is *optional*, but *recommended*.

---

**Note**: `ssh` does not understand advanced patterns;
To bypass this limitation, `assh` maintains a list of *known hosts* and regenerate the `~/.ssh/config` with all those expanded *known hosts*.

Without the wrapper, the `~/.ssh/config` risks to be outdated when connecting to a new host for the first time and you will need to launch the command again.

With the wrapper, `ssh` will *always* be called with an updated `~/.ssh/config` file.

## Getting started

1. Backup your old `~/.ssh/config`: `cp ~/.ssh/config ~/.ssh/config.backup`
2. Create a new `~/.ssh/assh.yml` file
3. Run `assh build > ~/.ssh/config` to validate the syntax of your `~/.ssh/assh.yml` file and automatically build your `~/.ssh/config` file
4. You are ready!

### [v1](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/tree/v1.1.0) (2015-07-22)

* Last Python version

### [POC](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/commit/550f86c225d30292728ad24bc883b6d3a3e3f1b1) (2010-08-26)

* First Python version (POC)

## Docker

Experimental: `assh` may run in Docker, however you will have limitations:

* The `assh` containers does not have any binaries except `assh`, you can't use `ProxyCommand`, `ResolveCommand`...
* Docker may run on another host, `ssh localhost` will ssh to Docker host

```console
docker run -it --rm -v ~/.ssh:/.ssh moul/assh --help
```

`assh` in Docker is slower and has more limitations, but it may be useful for testing or if you plan to use a Docker host as a remote Gateway

## Alternative version

* [v1](https://github.com/moul/advanced-ssh-config/tree/v1) (2009-2015) - The original implementation. It worked quite well, but was a lot slower, less portable, harder to install for the user and harder to work on to develop new features and fix bugs

## Troubleshooting

#### How to configure resolver to parse `/etc/hosts` and/or handle **mDNS** requests ?

**assh** resolves hostnames using the system built-in resolver, depending on the OS, you can enable new features and/or change modules order.

* [Linux - mDNS support (nss-mdns)](http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/)
* [Mac OS X - `/etc/resolv.conf` documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man5/resolver.5.html)
